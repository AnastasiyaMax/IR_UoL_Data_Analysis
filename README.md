# IR_UoL_Data_Analysis

In this intermediate Python course, you will learn how to apply data science methods and techniques. This course will provide you with knowledge and skills in exploratory data analysis, data visualization and linear models. The practical classes are project oriented and cover the basic topics of data science applications. By the end of the course, you will be able to perform your own projects in Python.

## Grading

Final grade = 0.2 * average grade for home assignments + 0.2 * midterm + 0.2 class participation (quizzes, problem solving, attendance etc.) + 0.2 * project + 0.2 * final lab

## Projects

TBA. For now you can start forming into teams of 3 people and choosing a theme for you projects. You will have to find a dataset, perform EDA, run and validate a few models and present us your findings.
